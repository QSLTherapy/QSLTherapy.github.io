        <h2>Nicole Wilkinson</h2>
        <p>Hello. My name is Nicole Wilkinson. I live in Queenstown with my husband, our two children and three dogs. I also have a cat called Rabbit, and a horse.</p>
        
        <p>Before embarking on this career I was in the NZ Army, and then spent 19 years with NZ Police. I also have a BA majoring in psychology.</p>
        
        <p>I have a Masters Degree in Speech Language Pathology from the University of Canterbury. I am currently doing further research into the nature of dysfluencies arising from people who have sustained brain injuries.</p>

        <h2>Why I became a Speech Language Therapist</h2>
        <p>I became a speech language therapist because I wanted to help people communicate. I am interested in all areas of communication — working with people who have lost their ability to communicate through strokes or head injuries, through to working with the very young who are struggling with their sounds or language.</p>

        <h2>My approach</h2>
        <p>I try to work holistically with my clients; for children — involving their families and schools/preschools — and for adults, involving those who support them. I believe that communication is a two-way process and it is very important for those around my clients to understand the nature of their difficulties, and what they can do to help.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq">
          <h3>Should I be worried that my child isn't talking as much as other children their age?</h3>
          <p>Children develop speech and language at their own pace, but there are some things to look for that may indicate you need some support. By 18 months your child should understand simple words and phrases and speak some single words. By 3 they should be able to understand and use simple sentences, and be understood by people outside your immediate family. If you have any questions about whether you should be concerned, feel free to give me a call to discuss.</p>

        <div class="faq">
          <h3>How long does therapy last?</h3>
          <p>This depends on your child's needs. Some children may only need a few sessions, while others may require more support. I will discuss this with you after completing my assessment.</p>

        <div class="faq">
          <h3>What ages do you work with?</h3>
          <p>I work with people of all ages — from babies through to the elderly. Communication difficulties can affect people at any stage of life.</p>

        <div class="faq">
          <h3>Can I get funding for therapy?</h3>
          <p>There are some options for funding depending on your situation. I can discuss this with you when we meet. Please note that I do not accept referrals for children who can receive services without charge from the Ministry of Education.</p>
