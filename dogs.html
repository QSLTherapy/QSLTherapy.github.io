        <p>I am often asked about using dogs in my therapy sessions. Research has shown that dogs can be very beneficial in therapy settings, helping to reduce anxiety, increase motivation, and create a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>All of my dogs are family pets first, and therapy dogs second. They are well-trained, gentle, and used to being around children and adults of all ages. However, I always check with clients (and their families) before including dogs in any session.</p>

        <div class="dog-section">
          <h2>Benson</h2>
          <p>Benson is our tan-coloured boy. He is about 5 years old and we adopted him from a family who could no longer keep him. He is very gentle and loves pats. He is also the reigning card-playing champion of the house.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dog-section">
          <h2>Flare</h2>
          <p>Flare is black and white. She was rescued as a farm dog who wasn't suited to farm work. She loves people and is very loyal. She can be a bit shy at first but warms up quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dog-section">
          <h2>Zoom</h2>
          <p>Zoom is our youngest — a Border Collie who was born in February 2020. She is very energetic and loves to play. She is still learning the ropes of being a therapy dog but is showing great promise.</p>
        </div>

        <p><em>If you have any concerns about dogs being present during therapy sessions, please let me know and we can make alternative arrangements.</em></p>
